# Feedback 
- Review #1: "I found it interesting that perhaps the influx of movie jobs has, in part, led to an increase in wages in Georgia.  I also took away that healthcare wages have steadily increased all over the country.  Some suggestions to improve the graphic would be to have a play and pause button and to show data by county or smaller so you can see specific areas within a state that may be affected more or less by industry changes."

- Review #2: "Maybe show a pointed hand symbol to show that an item is clickable.  I like how you can go back to each year and look at more detail.  It might be helpful to put the occupations in order and give a description of what they are"

- Review #3: "The visualisation looks great. The map title seems to stay at 2016 and doesn't change to reflect the year I chose from the options."

- Review #4: "When I am choosing anything from the drop down menu in the 2nd attempt, the year changes from 2011-2016-2012-2016-2013-2016 and so on. Is that a bug?"

- Review #5: "What do I notice ?

*Healthcare support operations and Social service operations which are one of the noble working areas have one of the lowest wages. Even Repair and Installation sector earns more than it.

*California is one of the better places to work in as it provides one of the best average wages.

Question about the data ?

*None

What relationships do you notice ?

Over the years, average wage of people employed in sectors like Computer and Management rise sharply whereas people in health sector didn't get any significant increase. States on the coastal regions have comparitively higher avg wage.

Main take away

*Avg wages for jobs involving Computers and Management are growing at a faster rate. Hence people working in MNC's are offered more wages than the people working in unorganised sector."
